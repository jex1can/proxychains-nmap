####The following are notes on how to use proxychains, sock4 server, and nmap to scan through a DMZ
like network.                                                                                 
                                                                                                 
#In order for this to work you will need to have already compromised a computer that has access
to the "internal" network. Once that machine is compromised use following metasploit commands:    
                                                                                                 
                                                                                                 
run autoroute -s x.x.x.0/24                                                                      
#x is the additional network discovered                                                          
                                                                                                 
#check to make sure this is added                                                                
run autoroute -p                                                                                 
                                                                                                 
#background that session and use search for socks4 server in msfconsole.                          
#change the port to whatever you prefer - dont leave deafult                                     
                                                                                                 
#after that, the server is running and we need to edit our proxychains.conf file                          
                                                                                                 
vim /etc/proxychains.conf                                                                        
                                                                                                 
#edit the last line to the same port number as the socks4 server 


#now we can use proxychains to scan the internal network with nmap

#To identify what boxes are availible quickly, we will use a -sn scan looking at port 80 - but you
#can change that to whatever port is preferred. Once that is complete, you can then use a more
#targetted scan on those boxes. commands to follow

proxychains nmap -sn x.x.x.0/24 --unprivilege > nmap.txt

#this will take a long time to compete - if it says okay and has a latency of 0.x then it means there is probably a box at that IP to target. To cut this down to something pretty to re use in an nmap scan we can do the following

cat nmap.txt | grep '(0.*' -B 1 | grep 172 | cut -d ' ' -f 5 > new_nmap.txt

#172 is the start of the IP address scanned, but this will give us a nice list of availble box to
#do a more intense nmap scan on with the following. 
#0.* -this is done because the latency for a box that is "up" is generally 0.x, on my scan 
#the other latency results were at 3.6s. 
#also it is worth noting that you can probably remove the first and last IP addresses from the list


proxychains nmap -sV -iL new_nmap.txt -unprivilege > full_nmap_scan_results
